## 🚀 HOW TO USE THE PROJECT

### Option 1: Open in Android Studio (Recommended)
1. Open Android Studio
2. Select "Open an existing project"
3. Navigate to the `5s` folder and select it
4. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
5. Click "Run" to install on device/emulator

### Option 2: Build APK from Command Line
1. Ensure you have Android SDK installed
2. Run the build script: `build-apk.bat`
3. APK will be created in `app/build/intermediates/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

### Option 3: Use Gradle Wrapper (if SSL issues resolved)
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## 🎮 APP FEATURES DEMONSTRATION

### Creating a New Game
1. Open the app
2. Tap "New Game"
3. Enter player names (e.g., "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
4. Tap "Start Game"

### Playing a Game
1. View the current scoreboard
2. Enter scores for each player for the current round
3. Tap "Next Round" to continue

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: ViewModels manage UI state
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access layer
- **Room Database**: Local SQLite storage
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI

### Key Components
- **GameViewModel**: Manages game state and business logic
- **GameRepository**: Handles data operations
- **Room Database**: Stores games and rounds
- **Navigation**: Single activity with Compose navigation

### Data Flow
1. User creates game → GameViewModel → Repository → Database
2. User enters scores → GameViewModel updates state → UI reflects changes
3. Game ends → Final scores calculated → Winner determined
4. Game history → Repository queries database → UI displays results
