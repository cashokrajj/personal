## 🔧 TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS

### **Architecture**
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracted data access
- **Room Database**: Local SQLite storage with type converters
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern declarative UI

### **Key Features**
- **GameViewModel**: Manages all game state and business logic
- **GameRepository**: Handles database operations
- **Room Database**: Stores games and rounds with JSON serialization
- **Navigation**: Single activity with Compose navigation
- **State Management**: Reactive UI with StateFlow

### **Data Flow**
1. User creates game → GameViewModel → Repository → Database
2. User enters scores → GameViewModel updates state → UI reflects changes
3. Game ends → Final scores calculated → Winner determined
4. Game history → Repository queries database → UI displays results
